## Haswell HP Envy DSDT patches by RehabMan

This set of patches/makefile can be used to patch your Haswell HP Envy DSDT/SSDTs.  It relies heavily on already existing laptop DSDT patches at github here: https://github.com/RehabMan/Laptop-DSDT-Patch.  There are also post install scripts that can be used to create and install the kexts the are required for this laptop series.
